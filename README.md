Getting Started
GitHub Classroom
In this course, we’ll use GitHub Classroom to distribute projects and collect submissions. To begin Project 1:

Click here to go to the GitHub Classroom page for starting the assignment.
Click the green “Accept this assignment” button. This will create a GitHub repository for your project. Recall that a git repository is just a location where your code will be stored and which can be used to keep track of changes you make to your code over time.
Click on the link that follows “Your assignment has been created here”, which will direct you to the GitHub repository page for your project. It may take a few seconds for GitHub to finish creating your repository.
In the upper-right corner of the repository page, click the “Fork” button, and then (if prompted) click on your username. This will create a fork of your project repository, a version of the repository that belongs to your GitHub account.
Now, you should be looking at a GitHub repository titled username/project1-username, where username is your GitHub username. This will be the repository to which you will push all of your code while working on your project. When working on the project, do not directly push to the mobile50/project1-username repository: always push your code to your username/project1-username repository.
FAQs
Is there extra credit for completing the challenge?
Nope, the challenge is just a fun feature that I recommend adding if you finish early!
Do we need to test on both iOS and Android?
Nope, as long as it works on at least one of the platforms, you’re all set. We’ll assume iOS unless specified otherwise.
How to Submit
Go to the GitHub page for your username/project1-username repository (note: this is different from the mobile50/project1-username repository).
On the right side of the screen, click the Pull request button.
Make sure that the “base fork” is mobile50/project1-username, and the “head fork” is username/project1-username.
Click “Create pull request”.
On the next page, click the “Create pull request” button again.
